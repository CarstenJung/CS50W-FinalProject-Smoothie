# Smoothie Web Application
Smoothie is a web application that allows users to create, view, and rate custom smoothies while providing detailed nutritional information using the API from https://www.nal.usda.gov/.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity:
As the name suggests, Smoothie is an app for putting together your own smoothies or asking for information about certain ingredients.

The data is processed and converted according to weights. The user is given a complete nutritional value table with various data on energy vitamins etc. based on their input.

### Complexity: The main functions of the app are
```
1. Search of ingredients.
2. Create your own smoothies and add ingredients by weight.
3. View all the fruit used in a smoothie with weight, energy and various vitamin data. Always calculated according to the corresponding input quantity.
4. Smoothies can be viewed and rated by all users under Custom Smoothies. The rating is calculated from the entries of all users.
5. A delete button is only displayed for the creator of the respective smoothie
```
